        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The interest for IT tech world have always been a part of my life since young. </p>
        <p>All way from the past when I went to my friends house to play games on the commodore 64 and to the modern days how much it have developed. </p>
        <p>From all application in the smartphone to robotics drones, home system controlled by smartphones with softwares and softwares in the computer.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>The first computer I got had the OS windows 98.</p>
        <p>It was then for the first time started to play Starcraft Original which had and still is one of my favorite games.</p>
        <p>And next the playstation 1 which alot of games like Tekken 3, Crash bandicoot and more.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>But anyway lets get to the point. My coding journey started for the first time around 2019 fall when I did little of small coding with Java at home by myself.</p>
        <p>It was then got into the programming world. I did small project at home like basic Java calculators and Km/h counters.</p>
        <p>I enrolled my first programming course in 2021 august and learned more about Java. In the course, I got tasks to make a Yatzy game and a more advanced calculator.</p>
        <p>In the year 2022 winter I took the second course of programming and learned for the first time about C# and OOP.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p> I created basic animal system that check if an animal exist in the program if user search for the animal and what kind of type of animal it is.</p>
        <p>My journey since then still continue until today. I'm today a .Net/Backend/Fullstack Developer student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan( Vocational University) and enroll a .Net/Backend/Fullstack program.</p>
        <p>My goals and mindset is always try to success and never give up on my work until it is done. No matter how much time it takes.</p>
        <p>I'm always open up for new knowledges, feedbacks to improve myself more and get better on my career for the future path that awaits me.</p>
